A Proxy Selection Tool for Windows
==================================

From time to time it is necessary to change the systems proxy settings. This
can be due to network changes or to test software with internet access on
different proxies or proxy settings. However, always walking through the
Windows system dialog and manually changing the settings is a tedious task.

Therefore, this small python project enables the quick change of the proxy
settings either programmatically by using the provided module functions, or
from the command line, by calling the command line scripts, that are part of
this project as well.
