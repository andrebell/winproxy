This\r\ncan be due to network changes or to test software with internet access on\r\ndifferent proxies or proxy settings. However, always walking through the\r\nWindows system dialog and manually changing the settings is a tedious task.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this small python project enables the quick change of the proxy\r\nsettings either programmatically by using the provided module functions, or\r\nfrom the command line, by calling the command line scripts, that are part of\r\nthis project as well.\r\n\r\n## The Command Line Tool\r\n\r\nThe proxy settings in Windows are basically given by four values:\r\n\r\n  - ProxyEnable\r\n  - ProxyHttp11\r\n  - ProxyServer\r\n  - ProxyOverride\r\n\r\nIf ProxyEnable is set to 0 no proxy will be used and if it is set to 1 the proxy\r\nsettings specified by the other values are in use.\r\n\r\nEvery value can be set individually or in combination with the \"winproxy set\"\r\ncommand. E.g., to set the server value specifically for http you can call\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy set --http proxyserver:port\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting a proxy server for all protocols to 10.0.0.1 on port 8080 except for the\r\nlocal network and enable the proxy is achieved by\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy set -e 1 --all 10.0.0.1:8080 -o 10.*.*.*\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince turning the proxy on and off is quite common, the command line utility \r\nprovides two convinience calls to turn the proxy on and off.\r\n\r\nTo turn the proxy on you have to call\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy on\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom the command prompt and to turn the proxy off you have to run\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy off\r\n```\r\n\r\nrespectively. You may want to display the current proxy settings by\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy view\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do have man proxy exceptions (overrides), you can limit the number of\r\nproxy exceptions displayed with the -n option:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy view -n 5    # Display only the first 5 exceptions\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nC:\\> winproxy view -n 0    # Don't display proxy exceptions at all\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full documentation of the command line interface will be given in the\r\ndocumentation [TODO: Add Doc and link]\r\n\r\n## The Python API\r\n\r\nThe python API for accessing and changing the proxy settings in windows is\r\nbuild around a class called ProxySetting. By default, every new object of this\r\nclass is initialized with empty default values.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from winproxy import ProxySetting\r\n>>> p = ProxySetting()\r\n>>> p.display()\r\nProxyEnable: False\r\nProxyHttp11: True\r\nProxyServer: \r\nProxyOverride:\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo load the current proxy settings from the registry you can use the method\r\nregistry_read().\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> p.registry_read()\r\n>>> p.display()\r\nProxyEnable: True\r\nProxyHttp11: True\r\nProxyServer: 10.0.0.1:8080\r\nProxyOverride: \r\n- <local>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may change the settings using the properties enable, http11, server, and\r\noverride, which can directly be set with a bool, bool, string or dictionary, \r\nand a list respectively.\r\n\r\nTo give an example, setting the proxy server to new settings for http and\r\nhttps, one could write\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> p.server = dict(http='10.0.0.1:8080', https='10.0.0.1:8081')\r\n>>> p.display()\r\nProxyEnable: True\r\nProxyHttp11: True\r\nProxyServer: http=10.0.0.1:8080;https=10.0.0.1:8081\r\nProxyOverride:\r\n- <local>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting the settings to the registry is achieved with the method registry_write.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> p.registry_write()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full documentation of the command line interface will be given in the\r\ndocumentation [TODO: Add Doc and link]\r\n\r\n## Change Log\r\n\r\n### 0.4.0a1\r\n\r\n* Changed winproxy set command line behaviour to only write those values to the\r\n  registry, that have been provided as parameter and leave all others as is.\r\n  This is way more flexible to use.\r\n* Added some short, tutorial-like documentation for the command line.\r\n\r\n### 0.3.0a1\r\n\r\n* Added a first draft of the set command\r\n* The winproxy view command was broken if\r\n  * no overrides were set at all\r\n  * less overrides were set, than should be shown at most\r\n* The override list may contain not only ';' separated proxies, but also ','\r\n  separated ones. This may even be mixed. Also, there may be whitespace in the\r\n  Text. This all is now corrected for, i.e., setting override through the\r\n  ProxySettings API will always normalize the string to ';' delimited proxies.\r\n* Missing registry values fall back to sensible defaults\r\n\r\n### 0.2.0a1\r\n\r\n* Added the \"winproxy cpl\" to the command line to open the Windows Internet\r\n  Settings dialog\r\n* Added a change log to the README\r\n\r\n### 0.1.0a1\r\n\r\n* Basic ProxySettings class for the Python API\r\n* Command line with \"winproxy on|off|view\" to\r\n  * turn the proxy on\r\n  * turn the proxy off\r\n  * display the current proxy settings\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\nAndre Alexander Bell <winproxy@andre-bell.de>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
